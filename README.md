# DataViews

This repository is an educational resource for the `@wordpress/dataviews` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/dataviews). It has been developed for the event [Core Days: Roma 2024](https://events.wordpress.org/rome/2024/coredays/session/intro-to-the-dataviews-component/). See also:

- [DataViews documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-dataviews/) for more info.

## Workshop

The starting point for the workshop is not runnable. For it to work, it's necessary to implement:

- The `view` & `defaultLayouts` config.
- The `fields`.
- The `onChangeView` callback.

When you are ready, run the app:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Coda

This demo favors educational code, it's not production ready.
